# LLM Middleware

This code (and readme) were created by my conversations with GPT4. Nothing has been tested and there is no guarantee anything will work.

LLM Middleware is an open-source solution that enables seamless integration of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 with various edge devices, IoT systems, and other platforms. It allows users to provide natural language instructions to the LLM, which are then translated into actionable commands for the connected devices. This middleware helps to bridge the gap between human language and machine protocols, unlocking a world of possibilities for intelligent and dynamic control of devices.

## Features

Integration with popular LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4
Customizable command interpreter for processing LLM outputs
Device connectors for various devices, such as IoT, robotics, and more
User interface for providing natural language instructions
Middleware core for orchestrating communication between LLM, command interpreter, and device connectors
Extensible architecture for adding support for new devices and communication protocols

## Getting Started

Configure the LLM credentials and device configurations in config.py.

Run the example script:

python main.py
